# Exploratory Data Analysis on Fantasy Premier League

This was a course project for an online course on [Jovian ML](https://jovian.ml/).

I found out some interesting insights of managing a FPL team. They are as follows:
- High percentage selected players come mostly from higher ranked teams in the real Premier League.
- Players having high ICT indexes generally result in high points. So, it is a good practice to have players with better ICT Index rank.
- It is seen that in ICT index, Influence rating is much more relevant in terms of getting more points than Creativity or Threat.
- Home or Away fixture doesn't really affect the points. But Home fixtures do have a very slight edge. So, if you want that slight edge maybe go for the Home fixture players.
- In general costly players are always better than mid-range or low-range players. But there are some mid-range players who are as good as high-range ones. Early detection of such players and transferring them in would be a good move. Also sometimes people get confused, whether they should go for some costly players and fill others with just okay players. Or get a team full of mid-range players. It is seen that the former strategy works better.
- Players actually playing well also generally give high points. There are some discrepancies, but mostly the correlation is linear.
